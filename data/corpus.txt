Vaccines do not cause autism. Large-scale studies involving more than one million children have found no link between vaccination and autism spectrum disorders.

The World Health Organization states that vaccines undergo rigorous testing in multiple phases of clinical trials before approval to ensure their safety and effectiveness.

Climate change is primarily driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, which increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.

Multiple independent studies confirm that the Earth is approximately 4.54 billion years old based on radiometric dating methods.

Antibiotics are effective against bacterial infections but do not work against viral infections such as the common cold or influenza.

The human immune system develops memory after infection or vaccination, allowing it to respond more quickly and effectively to future exposures.
